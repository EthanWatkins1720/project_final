                        <p>Don't ask how I got access to it, but I managed to get my hands on Nvidia's new 'quantum' GPU (whatever that means).
                            Let's just say the experience was less than stellar. First, it's not a GPU. I don't know who decided to call it a GPU. It has display out, sure.
                            But this is a compute unit first and foremost. It runs computations really fast! I'll give it that. It's not the fastest I've seen, but it's swift.
                            The real issue is that it's fast and WRONG. I've had to go back and redo so many calculations with the old machines since we decided to swap to these 
                            at my place of work. It sucks! They'd make better doorstops!</p>

                        <p>First, that other guy is insane. I work in the physics department at a pretty big university and we got the new Nvida quantum GPU's early due to a partnership
                            between the school and Nvida. I can't say which school it is but just know I'm not making it up! And these things. Are. AMAZING! They've spead up my calculations
                            so much! So much work that I used to have to do by hand can be done on this! And sure, there have been a few errors but not a ton! Besides, it's new hardware. Brand new!
                            You can't expect perfection so soon. Look at Nvida's track record and you're bound to see the pattern. This is worth sticking by!</p>

                    <p class="prev-author">Johnny B. Goode - August 27, 2017</p>
                    <p class="prev-desc">A part of their recent effort to gain an even stronger grasp on the professional market, Nvidia has unvealed
                        a new concept GPU using quantum computing. Aimed at the scientific community, a community Nvida has been notably absent in due to
                        specialized machines already existing, they hope this compact, scalable piece of quantum power will be the step that makes them
                        a name in every lab. When asked for comment, Nvida CEO Jensen Huang stated, "It's like a flux capacitor but for computers." After the
                        announcement, Nvida stock rose .05%.</p>
