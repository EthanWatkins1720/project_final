                        <p>A part of their recent effort to gain an even stronger grasp on the professional market, Nvidia has unvealed
                            a new concept GPU using quantum computing. Aimed at the scientific community, a community Nvida has been notably absent in due to
                            specialized machines already existing, they hope this compact, scalable piece of quantum power will be the step that makes them
                            a name in every lab. When asked for comment, Nvida CEO Jensen Huang stated, "It's like a flux capacitor but for computers." After the
                            announcement, Nvida stock rose .05%.

                            The design leans heavily on the design patterns introduced in the recently launched RTX 3000 series line of consumer gaming GPU's, an impressive
                            feat given the amount of processing power packed into the unit. It seems Nvida's new flow-through design pattern for air cooling GPU's has proven
                            itself powerful enough to handle the heat put out by these units.

                            Many universities across the globe have already been granted early release units via Nvida's education partners program in exchange for feedback and data
                            on the unit's performance in return. This program has long proven beneficial to Nvida as it was this program that lead to the creation of Nvida's highly 
                            successful Turing architecture. In the mean time, non-educational labs wait eagerly in the queue to be next to try this powerful card.
