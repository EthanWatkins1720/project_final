                        <p class="prev-author">Johnny B. Goode - August 27, 2017</p>
                        <p class="prev-desc">A part of their recent effort to gain an even stronger grasp on the professional market, Nvidia has unvealed
                            a new concept GPU using quantum computing. Aimed at the scientific community, a community Nvida has been notably absent in due to
                            specialized machines already existing, they hope this compact, scalable piece of quantum power will be the step that makes them
                            a name in every lab. When asked for comment, Nvida CEO Jensen Huang stated, "It's like a flux capacitor but for computers." After the
                            announcement, Nvida stock rose .05%.</p>

                            <p class="prev-author">J.B the Terrible - August 28, 2017</p>
                            <p class="prev-desc">Don't ask how I got access to it, but I managed to get my hands on Nvidia's new 'quantum' GPU (whatever that means).
                                Let's just say the experience was less than stellar. First, it's not a GPU. I don't know who decided to call it a GPU. It has display out, sure.
                                But this is a compute unit first and foremost. It runs computations really fast! I'll give it that. It's not the fastest I've seen, but it's swift.
                                The real issue is that it's fast and WRONG. I've had to go back and redo so many calculations with the old machines since we decided to swap to these 
                                at my place of work. It sucks! They'd make better doorstops!
